            Objectives
        </h2>
        <p>Big Data analytics has been transforming industry and
        science in various domains for the past few years, making
        possible the processing of Terabytes of data on a daily
        basis. This was enabled by the joint evolution of
        programming models, data-analysis algorithms and computing
        infrastructures.</p>
        
        <p>This course introduces the concepts and some of the main
        algorithms used for Big Data analytics. It presents the
        principles of the Hadoop ecosystem, Apache Spark, and it
        details the main algorithms for the analysis of large
        datasets, related to similarity search, mining of frequent
        itemsets, graph analysis, clustering, stream mining,
        recommender systems and advertising.</p>
    
        <p>By the end of this course, students will be able to write
          and deploy efficient parallel algorithms to analyze Big Data
          sources for various applications.</p>

        </span></a>
        Communication
    </h2>
    <p>
    Important information will be communicated through Moodle and/or Slack.
    Students are expected to consult these channels regularly.
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://moodle.concordia.ca/moodle/course/view.php?id=143302">Moodle page</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://tgteacher.slack.com/messages">Slack workspace</a> (join channel #bigdata--winter2022)</li>
    </ul>
    Students are also encouraged to communicate about course topics between
    themselves, with their TAs, and with the professor. Frequent
    communication is key to successful learning! However, to ensure a
    viable environment, the following rules must be respected, in
    particular for communications happening on Slack:
    <ul>
      <li>Spend a few minutes searching for answers on your own before asking 
        other people. 
      </li>
      <li>Keep an eye on the on-going discussions, and try to avoid asking
      a question that has already been asked.</li>
      <li>Use Slack's thread feature to follow-up on a question instead of
      posting replies to the main channel.</li>
      <li>Don't hesitate to chime in a discussion if you think you might help.</li>
      <li>Always use the public channel (#bigdata--winter2022) to ask your
      questions. In particular, never exchange private messages with your
      TA. If any personal matter has to be discussed, communicate with the
      professor. If you really need to send a non-public message to your
      TA, always involve the professor.
      </li>
    </ul>
    These rules are meant to ensure that most questions could be answered while keeping a 
    reasonable load on the instructors.
  </p>
  <p>
    The instructors are dedicated to providing a
    harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender
    identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
    appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate
    harassment of students or TAs in any form. Sexual language and imagery
    is not appropriate for any communication, in particular on Slack. For
    more information, please consult <a

  Course Evaluation
</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Lab assignments (25%)</strong>: You will be required
      to develop data analysis programs in Python using Apache
      Spark or Dask. There will be a total of three assignments. You must
      work on these assignments <strong>individually</strong>. The
      lab assignments are all due on a Friday evening, 11:55pm
      (see exact dates on the <a href="#schedule">schedule</a>
      table). A grace period of 48 hours will be automatically
      granted (assignments will be accepted until Sunday night,
      11:55pm), but <strong>no further extension will be
        granted</strong>. Assignments must be submitted through
      GitHub Classroom, you will receive a link for each assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exams (40%)</strong>: There will be a mid-term and a 
      final exam. Exams will be Moodle quizzes. The midterm will be 
      conducted in-class and will count for 10% of the final grade. The 
      final exam will count for 30% of the final grade. There will be no 
      substitution for a missed exam. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Project (35%)</strong>: 
      This course will walk you through the definition and implementation 
      of a data-science project using Big Data technologies. During the project clinics and lecture, the instructors 
      will guide you through the following milestones:
      <ol>
        <li>Project definition: you will define your own project by
        identifying: (1) a dataset of interest, (2) a set of research
        questions to be answered with the dataset, using techniques studied in class.
        If you are doing a
        Master or PhD thesis, you are encouraged to define a project linked
        to your research topic. </li>
        <li>Model design: choose a class of models in {supervised learning,
        recommender system, clustering, frequent itemset}. Outline how the data model
        could be applied to your dataset to answer your research question.
        Research algorithms and techniques to implement this class of
        model.</li>
        <li>Data preparation: inspect the dataset, identify missing data,
        outliers, data types (categorical data in particular), and write
        Spark or Dask programs to correct for potential issues.</li>
        <li>Model implementation: implement the model with Spark, Dask or
        scikit-learn.</li>
        <li>Model evaluation: identify evaluation metrics for your model. Implement and discuss them.</li>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      
      Projects will have the following deliverables. Deadlines are indicated on
      the <a href="#schedule">schedule</a>. No deadline extension
      will be granted.
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Team registration (5%)</strong> Easy points! Please
        register your team of <strong>4 students</strong> on time to allow
        for a smooth organization of project clinics.</li>
        <li><strong>Project summary (10%)</strong> The project summary will
        be a 400-word abstract available as a Markdown (.md) document in a
        GitHub repository. The summary will report on project definition and model design. It will describe the dataset and its
        main characteristics (number and type of features), the research
        questions to be addressed in the project, the class of models
        to be applied to the dataset, and the algorithms that will be used.
        At least two algorithms must be used and compared. The project summary will be evaluated during the project clinics (see <a href="#schedule">schedule</a> table).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Project data model (10%)</strong> The project data
        model will be delivered as a Jupyter notebook containing code and
        explanations to implement data preparation, model training and
        (optional) model evaluation. The project data model will be evaluated during the project clinics (see schedule table).</li> 
        <li><strong>Project presentation (15%)</strong> The project presentation will 
        be delivered during the last week of the course as a 6-10 minute presentation putting special emphasis on model evaluation 
        and summarizing the other project milestones.</li></ol>


        Project deliverables will be evaluated using the following
        criteria:
        <ul>
        <li>Originality (choice of the dataset, technology, problem) (10%)</li>
        <li>Clarity (writing, organization, code comments, slides) (20%)</li>
        <li>Relevance to the course topics (10%)</li>
        <li>Technical quality, including code comprehensiveness and quality (60%)</li>
        </ul>
          All criteria will be assessed on a 4-level scale: unacceptable, average, good, excellent. 
        
    <p><strong>Grading Scheme</strong>: There
      is no standard relationship between percentages and letter grades
      assigned. The grading of the course will be done based on the relative
      percentages assigned to the assignments, project and the exam. There is no
      definite rule for translation of number grades to letter grades.
