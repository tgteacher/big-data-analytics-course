# Session Two Examples

This folder contains samples which is described on the second session.
you can get some idea how you can implement hadoop MapReduce program and implementing same problems in the spark.
Therefore, you can compare two diffrent approach interms of implementation. 

# Samples which is developed in hadoop and spark are:

* Rational algebra operations:
  * Difference
  * Intersection
  * Projection
  * selection
  * Union
* Inverted Index
* Mean
* WordCoun

# Folder Structure:

1. hadoop-examples: `contains hadoop programs which is developed with java`.
2. spark-examples: `contains spark programs which is developed with python`.
3. inputs: `contains all inputs sample which could be used for programs testing in hadoop and spark examples`.
4. hadoop-output: `the result that you should get with running the hadoop examples`.
5. spark-output: `the result that you should get with running the spark examples`.

#Notes:

java version which is used for development is java 8.
python version which we used for running our program is python 3 
(python 3.6 doesn't work with spak).
python version setting is defined in each prgram as an environment parameter, and you can chage it to the version that you want to use.
